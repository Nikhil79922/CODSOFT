        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Running a gym is tough. State-of-the-art equipment and competitive pricing are important. But these are just
            a fraction of what makes a gym great. There are several cogs that work together to create a successful
            fitness business that retains members and drives value. Although the equipment you have can make or break a
            member’s decision to join your facility, the fitness experience will increase member retention. </p>
        <p>Joining a gym is a commitment. You have to invest your time and finances. With pay-as-you-go business models,
            monthly memberships, and digital subscriptions, there’s a membership style that suits everyone. But why do
            members return to a gym again and again? Even with pay-as-you-go style brands like Barry’s Bootcamp and
            SoulCycle, it’s common for users to visit the same fitness center. Let’s delve deeper into why members
            choose and stick with a specific gym.</p>
